/*
A Contest is held and a total of N participants took part in the contest. You are already given the scores
of the participants in the form of an array (of size N).
The contestant who has a score greater than or equal to the score of the K-th Participant (where K<=N)
will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant has a positive score.
Calculate the total number of participants who will advance to the next round.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers N and K separated by a single space.
The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the array.

Output
Print the number of participants who advance to the next round.

    Example 1
    Input
    8 5
    10 9 8 7 7 7 5 5

    Output
    6

    Explanation

    4 2
    0 0 0 0

    Output
    0

    Explanation
    None of the participants has a positive score.

Constraints
