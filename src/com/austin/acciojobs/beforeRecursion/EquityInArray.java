/*
Given an array of integers, determine the minimum number of elements to delete to leave only elements
of equal value.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer n, the number of elements in arr.
The next line contains n space-separated integers arr[i].

Output Format
A single integer denoting the minimum number of deletions.

    Example 1
    Input
    4
    1 2 2 3

    Output
    2

    Explanation
    Delete the 2 elements 1 and 3 leaving arr as [2,2]. If both twos plus either the 1 or the 3 are deleted,
    it takes 3 deletions to leave either [3] or [1]. The minimum number of deletions is 2.

    Example 2
    Input
    5
    3 3 2 1 3

    Output
    2

    Explanation
    Delete 2 and 1 to leave [3,3,3]. This is minimal. The only other options are to delete 4 elements
    to get an array of either [1] or [2].

Constraints
0<n<=100
1<=arr[i]<=100
