/*
You will be given an array of N integers. Write a recursive function to calculate its summation.

Input Format
The first line  contains one integer T denoting number of test cases.

Each of the next T lines will start with an integer N (1 <= N <= 100), number of integers followed by N space separated.

Output Format
For each test case, output one line in the format “Case x: a” (quotes for clarity), where x is the case number and a is the summation of the integers.

Example 1
Input

2
5 10 5 -2 3 0
3 100 -10 34
Output

Case 1: 16
Case 2: 124
Explanation

There are two test cases. For Case 1: the size of array is 5, adding 10 + 5 + (-2)+ 3+0= 16. Therefore, we print, Case1: 16. For case 2: the size of array is 3, adding 100 + (-10)+ 34= 124. Therefore, we print, Case2: 124.

Example 2
Input

 1
 2 1 1
Output

Case 1: 2
Explanation

There is one test case. For Case 1: the size of array is 2, adding 1+1= 2. Therefore, we print, Case1: 2.

Constraints
0 <= N <= 100

-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
