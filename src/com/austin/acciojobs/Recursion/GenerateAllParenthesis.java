Given an integer n, print all balanced bracket strings of length 2*n.

A bracket string is a string which contains only ( and ) as its characters and for each opening bracket there is a corresponding valid closing bracket.

Empty string is a balanced bracket string

If S is a balanced bracket string, so is (S).

If S and T are balanced bracket strings, so is ST
