/*
Given a positive integer N, find the Nth Even Fibonacci number.

Fibonacci Series is a series of numbers in which each number ( Fibonacci number ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.

Note:

Since the answer could be very large, use long datatype in JAVA to store the answer. Similarly, use long long in C++.

Return the answer in modulo 109 + 7

Input Format
First line contains the positive integer N.
