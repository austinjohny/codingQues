Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her
dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It is well known that universities provide students with dormitory
for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vičkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus
Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vičkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!

Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers A and B and then calculates
the greatest common divisor of integers "A factorial" and "B factorial". Formally the hacker wants to find
out GCD(A!, B!). It is well known that the factorial of an integer x is a product of all positive integers
less than or equal to x. Thus x! = 1·2·3·...·(x - 1)·x. For example 4! = 1·2·3·4 = 24.
Recall that GCD(x, y) is the largest positive integer q that divides (without a remainder) both x and y.

Leha has learned how to solve this task very effective. You are able to cope with it not worse, are not you?

Input Format
The first and single line contains two integers A and B (1 ≤ A, B ≤ 109, min(A, B) ≤ 12).

Output Format
Print the greatest common divisor of the factorial of both the numbers.

    Example 1
    Input
    4 3

    Output
    6

    Explanation
    Consider the sample.
    4! = 1·2·3·4 = 24. 3! = 1·2·3 = 6. The greatest common divisor of integers 24 and
    6 is exactly 6.

    Example 2
    Input
    6 10

    Output
    720

    Explanation
    Consider the sample.
    6! = 1·2·3·4·5·6 = 720. 10! = 1·2·3·4·5·6·7·8·9·10 = 3628800. The greatest
    common divisor of integers 720and 3628800 is exactly 720.

Constraints:
1<= A, B <= 10^9
min(A,B) <= 12
